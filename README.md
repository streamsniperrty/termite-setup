My installation and configuration guide to Termite.

### Debian

For Debian based systems, which include Ubuntu and Linux Mint, you won't have the Termite package available in the default repos.

Therefore, you will need to compile it from source.

sudo apt install gtk-doc-tools intltool libpcre2-dev libghc-gnutls-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgtk-3-dev
